			<h1>History of Glass</h1>
			<section id="ancient">
			</h2>Glass in the Ancient World</h2>		
				<p>Naturally occurring glass, especially the volcanic glass <i class="mineral">obsidian</i>, was used by many Stone Age societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, 
				due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded. However, Archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or ancient Egypt.</p>

				<p>The earliest known glass objects, of the mid third millennium BCE, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of metal-working (slags) or during the production of <i class="artterm">faience</i>, 
				a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing.</p>

				<p>Glass remained a luxury material, and the disasters that overtook Late Bronze Age civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt. 
				Indigenous development of glass technology in South Asia may have begun in 1730 BCE. In ancient China, though, glassmaking appears to have had a late start, compared to ceramics and metal work.</p> 

				<p>The term <i>glass</i> itself developed in the late Roman Empire. It was in the Roman glassmaking center at Trier, now in modern Germany, that the late-Latin term <i>glesum</i> originated,
			 	probably from a Germanic word for a transparent, lustrous substance. Glass objects have been recovered across the Roman Empire in domestic, funerary, and industrial contexts. 
			 	Examples of Roman glass have been found outside of the former Roman Empire in China, the Baltics, the Middle East and India.</p>

				<h2>Mediaeval Glass</h2>
				<p>Glass was used extensively during the Middle Ages. Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. 
				It was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, windows, beads, and was also used in jewelry.  From the 10th-century onwards,
 				glass was employed in stained glass windows of churches and cathedrals, with famous examples at Chartres Cathedral and the Basilica of Saint Denis. 
 				By the 14th-century, architects were designing buildings with walls of stained glass such as Sainte-Chapelle, Paris, (1203–1248) and the East end of Gloucester Cathedral. 
				With the Renaissance, and a change in architectural style, the use of large stained glass windows became less prevalent.  The use of domestic stained glass increased until most substantial houses had glass windows.
				These were initially small panes leaded together, but with the changes in technology, glass could be manufactured relatively cheaply in larger sheets. 
				This led to larger window panes, and, in the 20th-century, to much larger windows in ordinary buildings.</p>

				<h2>Glass in Modern Times</h2>
				<p>In the 20th century, new types of glass such as laminated glass, reinforced glass and glass bricks increased the use of glass as a building material and resulted in new applications.  
				Multi-story buildings are frequently constructed with curtain walls made almost entirely of glass, while laminated glass has been widely applied to vehicles for windscreens. 
				Optical glass for spectacles has been used since the Middle Ages.
				The production of lenses has become increasingly proficient, aiding astronomers as well as having other application in medicine and science.
				Glass is also employed as the aperture cover in many solar energy collectors.</p>

				<p>From the 19th century, there was a revival in many ancient glass-making techniques including <i class="artterm">cameo</i> glass, 
				achieved for the first time since the Roman Empire and initially mostly used for pieces in a neo-classical style.
				The <i class="artterm">Art Nouveau</i> movement made great use of glass, with René Lalique, Émile Gallé, and Daum of Nancy producing colored vases and similar pieces, often in cameo glass, and also using <i class="artterm">lustre</i> techniques.
				 Louis Comfort Tiffany in America specialized in stained glass, both secular and religious,
  				and his famous lamps. The early 20th-century saw the large-scale factory production of glass art by firms such as Waterford and Lalique.
   				From about 1960 onwards, there were an increasing number of small studios hand-producing glass artworks,
   				and glass artists began to class themselves as in effect sculptors working in glass, and their works as part of the fine arts.</p>

				<p>In the 21st century, scientists observe the properties of ancient stained glass windows, in which suspended <i class="sciterm">nanoparticles</i> prevent UV light from causing chemical reactions that would otherwise change image colors, 
				to develop photographic techniques for capturing true color images of Mars for the 2019 ESA Mars Rover mission.</p>
