		<h1>What is Glass?</h1>
			<p><strong>Glass</strong> is a non-<i class="sciterm">crystalline</i> <i class="sciterm">amorphous solid</i>
				that is often transparent and has widespread practical, technological, and decorative use. 
				The oldest and most familiar types of glass are "silicate glasses" based on the chemical compound <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_dioxide"><i class="mineral">silica</i></a>
			 (<i class="sciterm">silicon dioxide</i>, or <i class="mineral">quartz</i>),
				the primary constituent of sand. 
				The term <i>glass</i> is often used to refer to this type of material only.
				Of the many silica-based glasses, ordinary glazing and container glass is formed from a specific type called <i class="mineral">soda-lime</i> glass,
 				approximately 75% <i class="sciterm">silicon dioxide</i> (SiO2), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_oxide"><i class="sciterm">sodium oxide</i></a> (Na2O) from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_carbonate"><i class="sciterm">sodium carbonate</i></a> (Na2CO3), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_oxide"><i class="sciterm">calcium oxide</i></a> (CaO), also called <i class="mineral">lime</i>, and several minor additives.</p>

			<p>The most striking and characteristic feature of silicate glass is its transparency. Glass will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmittance"><i>transmit</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)"><i>reflect</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"><i>refract</i></a> light; 
				these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission.
		 		Glass can be coloured by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels. 
		 		This has led to extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and, in particular, stained glass windows. 
 				Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures.</b>
 		 		
 		 	<p>Because glass can be formed or moulded into any shape, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. 
 		 		In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads.
 		 		When extruded as fibre, glass can become a thermal insulating material or a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass"><i>fibreglass.</i></a>
    			Some objects have historically been so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses.</p>
