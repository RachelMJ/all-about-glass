		<h1>Production</h1>
		
		<p>Glass production involves two main methods â€“ the float glass process that produces sheet glass, and glassblowing which produces bottles and other containers.</p>
		<section id="glassblowing">
			<h2>Glassblowing</h2>
			<p>Dating from the middle of the 1st century BC, <i class="techterm">glassblowing</i> exploited a working property of glass that was previously unknown to glassworkers,
		 	inflation, the expansion of a molten blob of glass by introducing a small amount of air to it. 
		 	That is based on the liquid structure of glass where the atoms are held together by strong chemical bonds in a disordered and random network, 
		 	making molten glass is viscous enough to be blown and to gradually harden as it loses heat.</p>
		 
		 	<p>The earliest form, <i class="techterm">free-blowing</i>, involves puffing air into a molten portion of glass called a <i class="techterm">gather</i>
		  	which has been spooled at one end of the blowpipe. This has the effect of forming an elastic skin on the interior of the glass blob that matches 
		 	the exterior skin caused by the removal of heat from the furnace. The glassworker can then quickly inflate the molten glass and work it into a desired shape. 
			It is still widely used nowadays as a glassforming technique, especially for artistic purposes.</p>
		
			<p><i class="techterm">Mould-blowing</i> is an alternative glassblowing method invented during the first part of the second quarter of the 1st century AD.
			A glob of molten glass is placed on the end of the blowpipe, and is then inflated into a wooden or metal carved mould. 
			In that way, the shape and the texture of the bubble of glass is determined by the design on the interior of the mould rather than the skill of the glassworker.
			The development of the mould-blowing technique has enabled the speedy production of glass objects in large quantity, 
			thus encouraging the mass production and widespread distribution of glass objects.</p>

			<h2>Float Glass</h2>
			<p><i class="techterm">Float glass</i> is a sheet of glass made by floating molten glass on a bed of molten metal, typically <i class="mineral">tin</i>, although <i class="mineral">lead</i> and various low melting point alloys were used in the past.
			This method gives the sheet uniform thickness and very flat surfaces. Modern windows are made from float glass.
			Most float glass is <i class="mineral">soda-lime</i> glass, but relatively minor quantities of specialty <i class="mineral">borosilicate</i> and flat panel display glass are also produced using the float glass process.
			The float glass process is also known as the Pilkington process, named after the British glass manufacturer Pilkington, who pioneered the technique (invented by Sir Alastair Pilkington) in the 1950s.</p>
